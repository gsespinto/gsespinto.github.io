                "Meowster Chef" is a mobile game developed in Unity, created during a game jam. Built by a team of three,
                with me as the Game Developer, we designed the game's core concept within 48 hours, producing a playable one-level demo.
                This concept was then refined over eight months of part-time work as part of the GameJamPlus contest. At the world final
                in Brazil, we earned the title of European Champions.<br><br>

                The game centers around a global cuisine competition where players complete recipes through engaging minigames.
                Each minigame replicates a real-life cooking step, with some featuring original mechanics and others inspired by well-known
                mobile games and mechanics. This approach delivers an intuitive, accessible experience.<br><br>

                One unique requirement for this competition was to develop a business plan, prompting us to integrate monetization into the prototype.
                We added cosmetic items and offline ads, producing a more polished vertical slice of the final product.<br><br>

                As the team's developer, I was responsible for all coding, game system implementations, and most asset integration. One major technical
                challenge was creating scalable systems that integrated smoothly. For example, the Minigame Manager and Minigame base class streamlined the
                development of nine minigames (two unreleased), making iteration efficient.<br><br>

                Another challenge was building editor tools so our game designer could easily adjust minigames and visualize placements in Unity. 
                This involved custom editor classes and gizmos, the bigger example of which was the Level Maker—an inspector interface that allowed 
                us to construct level mockups with a few clicks, automating what had previously been a highly manual process.<br><br>
