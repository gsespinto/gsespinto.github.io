      <p class="title">CORIUM</p>
      <p class="bodytext"> Corium is a third-person stealth shooter, which plays out in a cyberpunk 
        setting. The player interprets the role of Emery, a agent hired by 'ADS', one of the three 
        corporations which rule the world in 2050.<br>
        <br>
        ​The prototype developed takes place in the first mission of the game, in which a small 
        army of soldiers of an enemy company invaded one of the 'ADS' headquaters and it's up to 
        Emery to stop the extraction of confidential information at all cost. The average duration 
        of the mission is 10 to 15 minutes. The game is inspired by franchises such as Ghost in the 
        Shell and Metal Gear Solid.<br>
        <br>
        ​I was the lead programmer of this project, but also did some concept art. I did all the 
        mechanical implementation and worked with the rest of the team to implement the assets and 
        other elements in the Unity game engine. I tried to work in frameworks which would allow for 
        the continuation of the development of the game, although we were only asked to do a vertical 
        slice, on our case the first mission.​<br>
        <br>
        What I am most proud of this project is the squad AI. The enemy NPCs, turrets and video cameras 
        work as squads, sharing information with each other. This created more interesting behaviours, 
        since one enemy could alert the others after seing the player or the corpse of a teammate, 
        encoraging the player to do stealth.
