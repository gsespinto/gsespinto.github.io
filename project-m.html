            <p class="title">PROJECT M</p>
            <p class="bodytext">
                'Project M', was the foundation of the project later known as 'Venari', a third person Action RPG
                game in which you play as bounty hunters that face monsters in a post-apocalyptic setting.<br>
                The original project was developed by a group of seven members, from which I was the gameplay
                and UI programmer. My academic delivery consisted of the Code Release milestone of the project,
                in which the code base for the project was completed.<br>
                The tools I utilized in this project were C++, Blueprints and the Unreal Engine, in combination
                with GitHub for the repository management.<br>
                I worked on systems such as melee combat, dialogue trees and inventory management. I documented
                my process, having in mind that the project would still be undergoing development after this delivery.<br><br />
                Some time after the academic delivery, I decided to revisit the project and try to build upon what I had developed.
                To do no disservice to my colleagues and their hard work, I decided to complete the vision we had in mind,
                with some deviations, using royalty free assets found in the unreal market store and on sites such as turbosquid,
                cgtrader, mixamo and freesounds.org, while also redoing the AI logic done by my peer. <br>
                My goal was to prove that the foundation of the project was scalable and to showcase the gameplay mechanics developed
                in a more appealing and engaging way.<br>
                There's still things to improve on the current state of the game, such as sound design and game balancing,
                but I won't be able to solely focus on them for the foreseeable future, so I decided to release this in between
                version of 'Project M'. Furthermore, this first boss was designed to highlight the gameplay of the agile character,
                so I plan to do another to showcase better the berserker one.
