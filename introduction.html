            Hello there! My name's Gon√ßalo Pinto and I am a video game programmer from Portugal.<br>
            I see myself as an eager learner, passionate about embracing new challenges,
            and always on the lookout for a bright and fun teamwork project. <br>
            I believe that teamwork, alongside a positive and proactive mindset, build the best foundations
            for successfull and innovative projects.<br>
            Besides coding, I do cheerleading. I consider both to be crucial in game development.
            On my spare time I enjoy playing videogames, reading and binging tv shows,
            due to the power they carry within the narrative to transport us to other worlds.
